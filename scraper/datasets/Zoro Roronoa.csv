https://www.ranker.com/list/best-one-piece-quotes/ranker-anime,"With over 700 episodes under its belt, you better believe that there are some seriously epic One Piece quotes. We've taken a look at some of the best One Piece moments , and extracted sayings, phrases, and one liners that really impacted those scenes. From Whitebeard's speech as he’s about to die - “On his proud back, or in his whole pirate life, there is no scar he got while running away!” to Zoro’s “Not even Death himself can take my life away!"" - these are some of the most awesome moments from the anime so far."
https://www.ranker.com/list/best-one-piece-quotes/ranker-anime,"Almost every character in One Piece has at least one memorable line, but these ones really stand out as either inspirational quotes that changed the story, or motivational quotes that really shaped a character into who they became. Our heroes, like Luffy, Law, and Nico Robin all have inspiring quotes, but there are also villains on this list as well. Donquixote Doflamingo is by no means a hero but his speech is still one of the best anime speeches of all time."

Even if you extinguish his bloodline, there's no way that their flame will ever burn out. It has been passed downsince ancient times. And in the future, someday, someone will appear, carrying the history of all those decades on his back, and challenge this whole world to a fight.

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Roronoa Zoro is one of the greatest swordsmen in One Piece and among Luffy's closest friends. Determined never to back down from a fight, his life has been full of hardships, struggle, and perseverance. He is sometimes so cantankerous that he even picks fights with other Straw Hats."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"RELATED: The 10 Unluckiest Characters In One Piece, Ranked"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Despite the darker facets of Zoro's life, there have similarly been many perks to make it well worthwhile. By identifying the greatest advantages of being him, it becomes clearer whether the path he has chosen is one that will provide satisfaction and fulfillment as the series reaches its final saga."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Before death , Kozuki Oden passed his legendary swords down to his descendants. Given that Momonosuke was not yet of age and his sister was not a combatant, Zoro was next in line to receive them."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Considering that these terrifyingly sharp blades were capable of cutting Kaido even without advanced armament haki, they were a massive advantage and some of the finest weapons in the series' universe. However, Zoro only received them in exchange for the sword he took from Ryuma at Thriller Bark. Nonetheless, he became more powerful for it."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Although Luffy treats the Straw Hats equally, it cannot be ignored that Zoro is his first mate. This has a number of connotations, both pleasant and dreadful. Not only does it entail that Luffy trusts Zoro more than anyone else, it is also an indication of his prodigious strength."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Should Luffy ever disappear for a prolonged period of time or is flagrantly killed, Zoro would likely be the one to inherit his mission in finding Roger's treasure. This would place him in an awkward position with Sanji."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"At first, it may seem as if Zoro has more glaring flaws in his toolkit than other Straw Hats. His dependence on swords limits his versatility and indicates powerlessness in certain situations."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"However, Zoro proved that he didn't need his weapons to be formidable against the Foxy pirates. By channeling the absurd power of ""Zero Sword Style,"" he defeated them with devastating strokes of his hand. He would later employ this skill in Wano when going undercover and unable to access his weapons easily."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Zoro's access to Conqueror's haki is extremely rare. It distinguishes him as a man with great will and outstanding purpose. So far, he is the only member on the crew able to channel it aside from Luffy. Even more advantageously yet, Zoro can completely control his haki and those it targets."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"This was profoundly useful when infiltrating Onigashima, as it allowed him to disable overly friendly Beast pirates without blowing his cover prematurely. It will also come in handy during future battles with the World Government, as the marines' forces almost always outnumber pirates significantly."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"As Luffy's right-hand man, it makes sense for Zoro to have one of the highest bounties of the crew. The last known price on his head was 320 million berries, likely having grown even larger by the end of Wano."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Part of Zoro's price is due to the actions he has taken against the World Government itself. In addition to attacking Morgan's forces, he assisted Luffy at Enies Lobby and helped enable escape from Kizaru after assaulting a Celestial Dragon. Zoro's high price is an indication of his lethality."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Usually pushing his body beyond physical limits, Zoro naps whenever he can. Though seemingly an endearing character quirk, it can also get him in trouble. For example, there have been numerous instances where someone tries to attack him while he is fast asleep."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"However, Zoro is almost always aware of his surroundings even while unconscious. This allows him to rest easily without worrying about being killed. His ability to remain well rested ensures that he will be combat ready whenever it is required of him by his captain or friends."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,Arguably Zoro's greatest perk is being a member of the Straw Hat Pirates. Each crew mate is exceptionally skilled in their craft and handpicked for Luffy's inexhaustible journey to Laugh Tale.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Though Zoro may be the strongest crewmate aside from Luffy, he would not be able to survive without his comrades. For example, Nami constantly ensures he does not lose his sense of direction, and Franky's Thousand Sunny sees the heroes through their treacherous journey across the high seas."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"After being whisked to his island by Kuma, Zoro realized that the only way to beat Mihawk is if he trained under him personally. Despite the man's incredible sense of pride, he begged for his assistance and even took a knee for him."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Amused and charmed by Zoro's perseverance, Mihawk instructed him to fight against a horde of personally trained baboons."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Despite initially being insulted, Zoro quickly learned that his primal sparring partners were a formidable match. By the time he reunited with his allies, Zoro was strong enough to carve through mountains and use Armament haki like an extension of his body."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Most of the series' strongest characters require devil fruits in order to be relevant. For example, almost every member of the four emperors had one in their possession (barring Shanks, so far as the audience knows)."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"However, despite being a yonko level threat, Zoro is one of the few characters to be powerful without one. Instead, he relies solely on his own strength and skill in order to win battles. In this regard, he fights more similarly to Gol D. Roger than Luffy does."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Despite not being his intention, Zoro is romantically successful. He accidentally seduced a confused Perona, who both enjoyed his company and could not stand his hard headedness. He similarly won Hiyori's affection, who came to see him as a stalwart and noble guardian."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-roronoa-zoro-perks/,"Eventually, she trusted Zoro so much that she even bequeathed him with her father's sacred weapons. Zoro's romantic success infuriated Sanji both out of typical jealousy and for the fact that he does not personally like the swordsman. Regardless, Zoro has yet to commit to a single partner due to the nature of his adventures."

https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"For too long, anime was treated as a subpar form of entertainment relegated to younger viewers and so-called weebs, whose excessive obsessions painted the medium as frivolous and childish. This perception is obviously far from the truth, as the anime medium has consistently produced series that have proven their worth many times over. From some of the most spectacular animation sequences of the 21st century to highly complex and multifaceted storylines, anime has become a source for sophisticated entertainment, on the same level as the best that movies and television could offer."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Although there are rightful criticisms about anime series' habit of treating dialogue lightly, there are far more examples of lines that shake the viewers to their respective cores. Moreover, a few anime quotes are actually far more powerful than how fans remember them. These lines highlight philosophical perspectives and subversive takes on humanity itself, not to mention offering important reminders about the world and how it works. In fact, anime quotes go hard far more often than people give them credit for."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Dragon Ball 's most iconic lines have included Vegeta's ""It's Over 9,000!"" and Goku's ""I am the hope of the universe,"" but little Gohan grows big enough to deliver some of the hardest anime quotes of all time. Gohan's general nature is pacifistic, making his threat bear far more significance than if it had come from someone like Goku. However, this moment clearly showcases Gohan as one of the most dangerous characters in Dragon Ball Z — and a threat that even Super Buu couldn't ignore."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"As the villain mocks the struggling heroes, Gohan openly challenges Super Buu with a level of confidence that radiates from every fiber of his being. This quote exemplifies Gohan's transformation over the course of his admittedly rocky journey, eventually leading to Ultimate Gohan's appearance for the first time in the series. Gohan's consequent battle doesn't end in victory, but he does help bring the villain down to a point where he can be defeated."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Best known as the Straw Hat Pirates' resident swordsman, Roronoa Zoro has always wanted to become the strongest swordsman in the world. This dream began during his childhood with Kuina, where both of them promised to achieve the same goal — until Kuina's accidental death. Since then, Zoro promised himself to reach for Dracule Mihawk's metaphorical crown. After joining Luffy's crew, he soon gets the opportunity to challenge the still-strongest swordsman in the world of One Piece ."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Zoro is defeated pretty much instantly, although Mihawk does him the honor of using his real sword to bring Zoro down. It is now that Zoro makes his second oath, this time directly to Luffy. Weeping for the first and only time in thousands of episodes, Zoro announces that he will ""not be defeated ever again."" Even fans who remember his declaration may not have noticed that Zoro has stayed true to his promise: since his loss to Mihawk, he has never been defeated in a one-on-one battle."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Cowboy Bebop is densely layered with themes and metaphors, inevitably resulting in some of the best anime dialogues of all time. That said, protagonist Spike Spiegel delivers his hardest quote in the anime's finale episode. Determined to fix the past by ending his toxic relationship with Vicious, Spike attempts to leave the Bebop for his last confrontation. Upon Faye's shock and hesitation to let him go, he tries to convince her by revealing his most secret truth."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"For all this time, Spike had been floating in a world between life and death, having lost his beloved and being forced to go on the run. Now he can finally prove the merits of his own existence to himself, even if it means sacrificing his life in the process. This is a particularly painful line, especially for older viewers, many of whom can relate to the feeling. Spike's earnest quote underscores both his personal dark cloud and the silver lining he can see hiding behind it."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood is filled to the brim with quotable gems, with the hardest-hitting sourced from Edward Elric's epiphanies. When Colonel Roy Mustang argues that ""the meaning and value of living"" revolves around being alive, Ed reacts with a line symbolizing a significant realization. Despite his role as the series' protagonist, Ed's personal understanding that he's not his world's main character reveals a level of self-awareness lacking in many other shonen heroes."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Ed and his brother Alphonse are on a journey of unquestionable import — restoring Ed's lost limbs and Alphonse's human body has been the goal from the outset. But Ed recognizes the potential of negatively impacting other people in the process of fulfilling his own dreams, painting himself as one of the show's most mature characters. This quote eventually leads to Ed's greatest sacrifice; unwilling to exploit living souls from the Philosopher's Stone, Ed gives up his alchemy in exchange for Al."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"My Hero Academia 's takes on the Western superhero genre could only take the anime so far; the rest of its brilliance lies in the character development and the dialogue. Deku's relationship with superheroism has always been different from his peers, as his Quirklessness prevented him from securing his greatest dream. When he does get the power from All Might, Deku hones his combat skills for the singular purpose of protecting other people. This is a common anime protagonist trope, but Deku's quote offers a new perspective."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"While trying to escape Hero Killer: Stain's clutches, Ida angrily implies that he never asked for Deku's help. Reacting with even more anger than his friend, Deku furiously reminds him of the defining characteristics of a hero. Deku's faith in himself is later pushed to the limits, but he never once goes back on his word. This quote is symbolic of Deku's persistence in the face of potentially fatal challenges, firmly paving his path toward true heroism."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Sometimes, the most innocuous anime series end up with quotes capable of boring holes through the viewer's consciousness. Mewtwo's legendary performance in Pokémon: The First Movie comes to mind, where he's pitted against Team Rocket. Mewtwo's discovery of his own origins — a sentient experiment designed to be the world's strongest Pokémon — leads to an identity crisis that soon resolves itself into this memorable quote."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Borrowing from the philosophical musings of both Western and Eastern philosophers, Mewtwo correctly surmises the difference between nature and nurture. Despite being created to serve as a weapon, Mewtwo reminds both himself and the viewers that what people ""do with the gift of life... determines who"" they are. A similar quote was said by Skyrim 's Paarthurnax, who asked if it was better ""to be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort."" While both lines are equally impressive, Pokémon 's demographic makes Mewtwo's delivery significantly more impactful."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Demon Slayer 's Tanjiro Kamado recently displayed his growing powers in the Infinity Castle movie. That said, shonen protagonists are always expected to wield enormous strength. The difference between Tanjiro and his peers, however, is the former's unrelenting sense of empathy. It doesn't matter if he's mourning a dear friend or killing a vicious demon — Tanjiro maintains his compassion for the dead and the dying."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"At the same time, watching Tanjiro get mad is both terrifying and delightful because he often goes into a manic frenzy. In this state, he doesn't care about authority or hierarchies; the only thing of importance seems to be justice, equality, and fairness. When Sanemi brutally impales Nezuko with his blade, Tanjiro headbutts him while delivering a potent line about the Wind Hashira's own competence. Tanjiro's quote is a stern reminder that even the so-called greatest heroes are accountable for their mistakes."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Jujutsu Kaisen 's best quotes are mostly comedic or badass, but there are also a number of introspective observations that highlight the show's enduring popularity. Mechamaru, a side character who makes a deal with the monstrous Mahito to restore his body, feels the shame and guilt of being born with his condition. He's willing to take things beyond the realms of loyalty and honesty just so that he can restore his severely incapacitated body."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"During their battle at the Kyoto Sister School Exchange Event, Panda states that he understands Mechamaru's pain, internally citing his own nature as a cursed corpse. However, Panda also warns Mechamaru not to overinflate his own sufferings, with a corollary that ""having more hardships doesn't make [Mechamaru] right."" Fans were taken aback by the sheer emotional force of this quote, which feels like something from literary fiction rather than a popular anime. There's a reason why ""two wrongs don't make a right"" is a common proverb."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Anime series frequently venture into military territory — from Naruto 's Great Shinobi Wars to the upcoming ""final battle"" in One Piece , large-scale conflicts are great to explore in fiction. With a few exceptions, like Attack on Titan and Code Geass , the metaphors of war in anime play very tiny parts in the overarching storyline. On the other hand, Bleach summarizes the philosophy of the battlefield in one succinct line, delivered with morbid perfection by Captain Shunsui Kyoraku ."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"As the Shinigami of Soul Society attempt to fend off Aizen's Espada, Shunsui makes it his personal mission to defeat the strongest villain on the scene: Coyote Starrk. He even interferes with his colleagues' battles against the Primera Espada, claiming that there's no good and evil when it comes to war. Shunsui sagely suggests that the battlefield is a place for conflicting ideologies and that morality has no place in matters of war."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure tackles a meta-comedy approach that can occasionally become too much for viewers. Meanwhile, the anime also features an array of devastating quotes that leave viewers ruminating on their meanings for a long time. Considering JJBA 's frivolous treatment of powers and the consistent popularity of the manga medium, however, Rohan Kishibe's quote hits delightfully hard. Kishibe plays a major role in Diamond Is Unbreakable , but his popularity allowed him to come back in the ongoing manga one-shot titled Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan ."
https://www.cbr.com/best-forgotten-anime-quotes/,"Rohan Kishibe's proud declaration about his motivations for drawing manga syncs perfectly with the standard shonen hero's vision -- it's not for glory, but to enrich the lives of his readers. Kishibe rejects fame and money as meaningless acquisitions in the pursuit of creating art, reminding viewers to focus on what matters the most to them. And since Kishibe is supposed to be a stand-in character for the JJBA mangaka, this revealing quote might as well be coming directly from Hirohiko Araki."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"One Piece is packed with not just cool worldbuilding and exciting fight scenes, but also some incredible dialogue to bring all these characters and their world to life. Dialogue is often the best way for characters to express themselves and comment on the world they live in, and the best quotes will stick in viewers' minds for many years to come."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"One Piece may have plenty of cheap and silly dialogue, such as shouting attack names or friendly banter, but the dialogue isn't all fluff. In every story arc, the best One Piece characters will have something profound or meaningful to say, which often encapsulates exactly who these characters are and what they stand for."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"- Monkey D. Luffy, One Piece Clockwork Island Adventure"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Protagonist Monkey D. Luffy might blurt out a lot of nonsense in One Piece , but he's not as foolish as his worst dialogue would suggest. Luffy puts more thought into his adventure and his life than many other One Piece characters give him credit for, and his dialogue reflects this. His best quotes also stem from his practical, go-getter ESTP personality type."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Luffy is always working toward the future, and even if he's not a crafty schemer or meticulous planner, he has the right attitude to seize his destiny and make something of himself. Planning and strategy are great, but action and confidence are what turn dreams into reality so a person, pirate or not, can unlock the future they want."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,I understand starving people more than anyone.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"- Sanji Vinsmoke, Chapter 854"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Luffy's chef and crewmate Sanji Vinsmoke often acts self-centered in One Piece , from seeking out the All Blue for his own culinary purposes to chasing after women for his own pleasure. Rarely does Sanji show any sympathy or emotionally support others, but if he meets the right people, he will show them kindness after all."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Sanji's quote about starving people proved that for a tough guy like him, it takes personal experience for Sanji to truly connect with someone and understand their hardships. This harkens back to Sanji's rough experience on that chunk of rock with Zeff, where they nearly died of starvation, and it helps explain why Sanji detests wasting food."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,Bring on the hardship. It's preferred in a path of carnage.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"- Roronoa Zoro, Episode 300"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Roronoa Zoro the swordsman has a tough-guy persona, and he often speaks in terse, harsh ways to express himself and what he thinks of others. This means Zoro has some of the best and coolest dialogue among One Piece 's main characters, including his quote about living a life of challenges and hardship."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Zoro knows that as a pirate serving the future pirate king, his career will be filled with deadly challenges. Instead of fearing that hardship, Zoro embraces it all as a chance to grow stronger and prove himself. Zoro understands that no one, warrior or not, improves themselves when they're comfortable."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"One Piece's universe holds many secrets, and the World Government likes it that way – leaving many citizens clueless about the world they live in."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,In order to draw a map of the world.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Nami was always fascinated by maps, and she vowed to become a great cartographer who would draw a map of the entire world. Now, Nami can realize that lofty dream as Luffy's navigator, and she applies this philosophy to life in general."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Trying to pay Arlong's debt Nami was always shackled to her home town. After Luffy freed her, she was able to truly explore the world without guilt or pain. A life can be either spent or wasted, but will end regardless, so Nami believes people can and should spend their lives creating something incredible and make their limited time mean something."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Even if there are billows of smoke, we can still see the sky. We can still see the ocean! It ain't like it's hell here! So don't act like you're about to die!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Like his captain Luffy, Usopp the sniper king has plenty of goofy and forgettable dialogue, and he's also prone to telling tall tales , hence his big nose. However, Usopp also has some heartfelt things to say, usually to help motivate his crew and show what a wonderful, caring person he is."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Usopp's line about not acting like someone is about to die is a fairly standard shonen sentiment, but it still means a lot. No one, certainly not a Straw Hat, should give up before they die and deny themselves one last chance to fight back. If someone has lost in their mind, then they will definitely lose on the outside, too."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"With declarations of war, and significant timeskips, One Piece plotlines rank among the best that shonen anime has to offer."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"I realized that back then, the reason I wanted to become human, was that I really just wanted to have friends. Now, I just want to be a monster that can help Luffy."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"- Tony Tony Chopper, Episode 81"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Tony Tony Chopper the reindeer made his debut in the Drum Island story arc, as the disciple of the late Dr. Hiriluk and an associate of Dr. Kureha's. Chopper ate a Devil Fruit to be more human, including talking and walking upright, but when he met Luffy, Chopper wasn't afraid to be his original self."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Chopper found acceptance and validation with Luffy's crew, so he no longer tried so hard to hide his monster side. Chopper felt free to use his Rumble Balls to become a great shaggy beast who can pummel his enemies for Luffy's sake, and that kind of self-acceptance means a lot coming from an animal who rejects being his actual species."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"You know, kid, laughter is the key to happiness. When you’re happy, you laugh. So it follows that you’ll become happy when you laugh… Try laughing. When times are tough, just laugh!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Nico Robin is a clever, independent-minded kuudere who joined the Straw Hat crew as the Alabasta arc ended. For a time, Robin kept her true feelings and past life to herself as a mysterious Straw Hat, but eventually, One Piece fans learned the truth. Nico Robin had been through a lot, and it almost broke her."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Robin was ready to give up and handed herself over to the World Government at Enies Lobby to save her friends, but then she was inspired to survive after all. Nico Robin's emotional resilience is expressed well in her quote about hard times, since laughter is indeed the best medicine. It can refresh the mind and give someone the resolve and willpower to face their hardships once again."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Vegeta is one of the most iconic characters in the Dragon Ball franchise, and some of his best lines can be found in Dragon Ball Super."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"The cyborg shipbuilder Franky, like Luffy and Usopp, tends to have a lot of silly dialogue for the sake of comic relief throughout One Piece . Still, Franky can be serious if he sees fit, such as his quote to Nico Robin in the Water 7 saga 's climax at Enies Lobby."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Franky's line was most resonant for Nico Robin, who felt like a criminal just for being a well-read scholar from Ohara, but it can apply to anyone. Even if someone has made past mistakes or comes from a rough place, their past does not make them a bad person, and they can always find new ways to validate themselves in the present."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,Being dead is never an apology.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Brook the musical skeleton often talked about death and bones for obvious reasons, sometimes for humor's sake and sometimes to say something profound. Brook has a unique view on death and the afterlife, having already died once, and he's determined to not glamorize death for any reason."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Brook highly values life and can't stand it when people choose to embrace death instead. For example, Brook noted that a person's death cannot make things right, and a person cannot make up for their past wrongs by ending their lives. Death won't erase what happened, and even if the dead person's enemies are satisfied, it's an empty satisfaction."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"During the climax of the Summit War saga at Marineford, Ace suffered a mortal blow and knew he didn't have long. So, he held Luffy one more time and said what always meant to say: to thank Luffy for being his loving brother.
