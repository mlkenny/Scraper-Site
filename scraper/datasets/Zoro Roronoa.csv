https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"As the first character to join Monkey D. Luffy's crew, Roronoa Zoro is one of the most important pirates in the world of One Piece . Despite his horrible sense of direction, he possesses a unique perspective and a surprising amount of wisdom that has been integral in moving the crew forward. Thanks to these traits and his skills as a swordsman, Zoro consistently ranks as the second-most popular character in the entire series."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Zoro is determined, loyal, not afraid to speak his mind, and regularly serves as the Straw Hat Pirates' voice of reason. Since the aspiring swordsman is Luffy's First Mate, it's up to him to fill the role of leader when the captain is absent or occupied with other matters. With these characteristics, in addition to his many incredible battles, Zoro has amassed numerous noteworthy quotes throughout his time on One Piece."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Updated on June 3, 2025, by Natasha Elder: Roronoa Zoro is a fan-favorite character in One Piece in no small part due to his memorable dialog. From funny to cool to surprisingly poignant, Zoro has a wide array of iconic lines. These moments help define his character, revealing different facets of his personality. This list was updated with more of the best Zoro quotes from One Piece and to reflect CBR's current style guide."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,How are you feeling down there? The moment your hope turned into despair.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Roronoa Zoro is rightfully recognized as one of the coolest characters in One Piece , in no small part due to quotes like this. In One Piece Film: Gold , the Straw Hat Pirates visit Gran Tesoro, a seeming wonderland made of gold. The dark underbelly of the city soon reveals itself, and Zoro finds himself a captive of the city's leader, Gil Tesoro. During Zoro's captivity, Tesoro tells Zoro he can't wait until the Straw Hat Pirate's hope turns into despair."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"The Straw Hats love and respect their captain Luffy, but these moments showed Zoro might be the one truly holding the crew together."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"When the other Straw Hats free him, Zoro wastes no time in mocking Tesoro with his own words. This coolly delivered quote is matched by Zoro putting on his bandanna, showing how serious he is. The line combines with Zoro's actions to perfectly display his impressive ability to remain calm no matter the situation , as well as his ever-present eagerness to battle."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"One of Zoro's most defining characteristics, aside from his drinking, is his sleepiness. He has fallen asleep at many inopportune times. For example, he slept through Nojiko's exploration of Nami's backstory and, upon returning to Sabaody Archipelago after the time skip, fell asleep on another crew's ship. Luckily, he is also skilled enough to wake up in time to handle any danger that arises."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"The submerging pirate ship Zoro was on ended up being sliced in half. When Kaku attacked the Thousand Sunny during the Egghead Island arc, Zoro woke up in time to protect the Straw Hat's ship. This Zoro quote highlights both how much he enjoys napping and how little that affects his ability to fight. It is also a humorous line, given the considerable effort Kaku is putting into his attack and how little effort Zoro needs to deflect it."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Throughout One Piece , the series makes it clear that East Blue is the weakest of the seas. Various characters make comments on this, even though Gol D. Roger himself was from the East Blue. Dr. Indigo, one of Shiki the Lion's subordinates from One Piece Film: Strong World , makes his own opinions on East Blue obvious when he and Zoro fight. As Dr. Indigo launches his attacks, he also launches a barrage of comments about the weakness of East Blue residents."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"If being born in the East blue makes me a good-for-nothing, then what about you, being slashed by me?"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Right before Zoro defeats Dr. Indigo, he says this quote with a deadly calm. This bit of dialogue makes Dr. Indigo's take-down even more satisfying. It is not just about getting a cure from Dr. Indigo to cure Nami's illness, but it also becomes a greater representation of not allowing others' opinions to define oneself. Zoro and the rest of the Straw Hats have made a habit of defying expectations, and this is just one more instance of doing so."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"One of the most anticipated moments in the Wano Country arc was the battle between Big Mom and Kaido. Luckily, it did not disappoint. One of the stand-out moments was when Zoro blocked a dual attack by the two Emperors of the Sea. When doing so, he urged the others on Onigashima's roof to get away from the attack. This skirmish is not only an awesome moment due to the animation but also because of what these words represent."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Get away! You guys! If you don't get away, we'll be wiped out!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Zoro is willing to sacrifice himself to save others. While the most famous moment that he proves this is during Thriller Bark, fans shouldn't discount his actions during the Onigashima Raid, either. He knew that blocking the attack could kill him or at least greatly injure him, but he was willing to do so anyway if it gave the others a chance to win."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"When Roronoa Zoro is first introduced, he is a prisoner at the Marine Base located in Shells Town. The Marines arrested the bounty hunter after he prevented them from harassing the town's citizens, and on the orders of Captain Axe-Hand Morgan, he was strung up and left for dead. When Monkey D. Luffy stumbles upon Zoro, the prisoner has no intention of taking up life as a pirate."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"I'll become a pirate, that I can promise you."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"However, Zoro eventually sees the potential in the Straw Hat Pirate, and, upon being saved from his execution, he pledges his life to One Piece 's loudmouthed protagonist. When this Zoro quote was spoken, One Piece fans knew for certain that Zoro's in it for the long haul, as it was clear that he had no intention of going back on his word. Although, fans at the beginning probably didn’t predict that he would be journeying with the Straw Hats for over 1,000 One Piece episodes ."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,Only I can call my dream stupid!
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"In the Grand Line, the most successful pirates are those who steadfastly strive to achieve their dreams. Zoro's goal of becoming the World's Strongest Swordsman is the source of his burning ambition, so when Sanji mocks his aspirations, Zoro is understandably cross. The Straw Hat Pirates' resident swordsman tells Sanji that only he can mock his dreams, setting the tone for their tenuous relationship moving forward."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Roronoa Zoro's romantic future is still up in the air, but there are plenty of One Piece characters who would make options for him."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Besting One Piece 's most skilled swordsmen is a fool's goal, but Zoro won't allow anyone to disrespect it. Some Zoro quotes may sound silly out of context, but that's the magic of One Piece — seemingly cartoony lines with a lot of emotional and thematic weight to them. His promise to his childhood friend and rival Kuina certainly gives his goal more weight and makes it even more understandable that he is so defensive about it."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Unlike most Straw Hat Pirates, Zoro encounters his ultimate rival during One Piece 's preliminary saga. Dracule Mihawk, the World's Strongest Swordsman , squares off with Zoro during the Baratie Arc, immediately demonstrating the sizable gap between their abilities. Despite Zoro’s best efforts, he doesn’t even come close to leaving a scratch on the greatly superior swordsman."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"After suffering a brutal defeat at the hands of Mihawk, Zoro turns around to proudly face him. Then this Zoro quote is spoken, wherein he states that a scar on his back would bring him shame as a swordsman; by doing so, he gains a tremendous amount of respect from Mihawk, who consequently decides to spare his life. This also gives a glimpse into Zoro’s unflinching nature , as he would rather die for his goal than give it up for even one second."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"After his duel with Dracule Mihawk, Roronoa Zoro sustains some serious injuries. It takes Zoro multiple arcs to recover from these wounds, but despite his state, he faces off against one of the Arlong Pirates' top commanders, Hachi , during the Arlong Park Arc. During his fight with Hachi, Zoro collapses from his injuries. Not only does this infuriate Hachi, but his fall makes everyone believe that he's on the brink of death."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"There's a certain man I have to face. Until I see him, Death himself cannot touch me."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Somehow, though, the three-sword-style fighter gets back up. Zoro then lets Hachi know that he refuses to die until he defeats Mihawk, again displaying Zoro’s impressive grit. This also lays the groundwork for future instances of Zoro fighting through a lot of pain to accomplish his goals, such as when he takes Luffy’s pain in Thriller Bark and fights King in Wano. When an enraged Hachi charges Zoro, the swordsman promptly defeats the Fish-Man, proving his remarkable skill in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"A swordsman's relationship with his swords is part of what determines his talent in battle, and few characters in One Piece are more intimately connected to their swords than Roronoa Zoro. This is on full display in the Loguetown Arc when Zoro discovers two blades, the Sandai Kitetsu and Yubashiri, while out shopping. Sandai Kitetsu in particular leads to a memorable moment given the bloody history behind the sword."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,How about we find out which one is stronger...the sword's curse or my good luck?
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"The owner of the sword shop refuses to let Zoro purchase Sandai Kitetsu, claiming that it is a cursed blade that killed every one of its owners. However, this does little to discourage the Straw Hat Pirate, as he immediately pits the power of its curse versus the power of his good luck. Luckily for Zoro, his luck holds out, and he gains a sword that has seen him through his future trials."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"During One Piece 's Whiskey Peak Arc, the Straw Hat Pirates are ambushed by a slew of members from Baroque Works. Zoro ends up facing this miniature army by himself, and after defeating most of them, the remaining members brag about their rank within the organization. Unimpressed by their claims, Zoro proclaims that titles mean nothing in combat before wiping out the remaining agents."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,I've found that fancy titles mean nothing when it comes to fighting.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-roronoa-zoro-quotes/,"Given the fact that Monkey D. Luffy's first mate ultimately defeats Mr. 1, the second-strongest member of Baroque Works, it's obvious why he felt disrespected by its weaker members. Moreover, it makes sense that someone who challenges a Warlord of the Sea without flinching is not impressed by the bragging of Baroque Works members. As proven throughout the show, Zoro is a character that appreciates actions more than words , and thus it is unsurprising he cares little for the bounty hunters’ posturing."

https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Zoro's determination and focus on surpassing limits, as seen in his battles, demonstrate his unyielding pursuit of becoming the best swordsman."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,Zoro's past and promise to his best friend Kuina drive his ambition to reach new heights and fulfill her dream of becoming the world's best swordsman.
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Roronoa Zoro is a member of the Straw Hat Pirates, and he is among the best swordsmen in the series. Introduced in Shells Town, Zoro joined the crew after Luffy rescued him from certain death."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"When it comes to the Paramecia class, these One Piece characters are the best at using their Devil Fruits."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"As one of the main characters in One Piece , Zoro receives a lot of screen time. Needless to say, every time he appears on the screen, he makes the audience sit on the edge of their seats. While his talent lies in his swordsmanship, Zoro has provided some of the most iconic quotes in One Piece . Given that there are so many of them, the list will cover the best ones."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Updated on June 15th, 2024, by Suzail Ahmad: Roronoa Zoro doesn't just have sharp blades; his mind is quite sharp as well, aside from his gags. Zoro didn't become an elite fighter by just using his physical strength. In fact, he is one of the few fighters who have honed their skills by training for years."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Whenever Zoro is met with an obstacle, he analyzes his opponent and figures out their weakness, eventually securing the win. Zoro's leadership skills are also underrated, and his words have helped the crew through tough times. Zoro's impactful lines have become rather popular, and there are often debates about his best quotes ."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"In One Piece , friendship plays a critical role. The bonds that the Straw Hats have forged have helped them overcome many difficult situations. They have put their lives in danger to keep each other alive."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"In Alabasta, Zoro highlighted the essence of team spirit. He stated that a person should try to do the best they can, which will motivate others around him to do the same. This is a brilliant quote that shows Zoro's maturity and proves that, in Luffy's absence, he is the perfect person to lead the crew."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,This quote is non-canon and only happened in the anime.
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Roronoa Zoro is one of the few characters who have attained success by constantly putting their bodies in danger. Throughout the story, fans have witnessed Zoro getting wounded and avoiding death narrowly, yet he has never been one to be deterred by it."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"These One Piece characters existed during the Void Century, but they left a lasting impact on the story."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Zoro's opponents have been strong and have held prestigious titles, but the swordsman has learned through experience that it doesn't make any difference. What matters is an individual's determination and how far they are willing to go in order to win. In most cases, it is Zoro who is hungrier and more resolute, which is why he is able to pull through in the toughest of conditions."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Zoro's fights have always been intense and full of action, so fans are always eager to see him in battle. His goal is to become the best swordsman in the world, and he knows that he cannot accomplish such a feat without putting in the effort."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"This quote signifies that Zoro is aware of the fact that the people standing in his way are exemplary fighters, especially Mihawk. Zoro knows that he has to reach new heights as a swordsman before he can take down the opponents that stand in his way. He has already reached an incredibly high level, but there is still some space left for improvement."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Every character aspires to become great, and the Straw Hats are not an exception. They also have various goals, and every single one is dedicated to accomplishing them. Some of the crew members have dreams that require a lot of hard work and a bit of luck."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"In Zoro's case, his objective is to become the best swordsman, which some people may find too ambitious. Whenever someone has tried to mock Zoro's dream, he has clearly stated that only he has the authority to ridicule it. He treats it very seriously and will do everything it takes to ensure that he realizes it at some point in the future. Part of the reason why Zoro and Luffy get along is because the two share dreams that others find too big."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"The Wano Country arc was the toughest challenge for all the Straw Hats. Every single one of them had to fight strong opponents, and most of them managed to come out on top. Zoro had to battle against King, the right-hand man of Kaido. King's Lunarian traits and his Devil Fruit made it extremely difficult to hurt him."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Zoro had to dig deep to find inspiration from somewhere, and it came from a flashback. He remembered his childhood when he met Shimotsuki Kozaburo, the creator of Enma. The conversation helped Zoro tame the sword temporarily and slice through King's strongest attack. After defeating King, Zoro proclaimed that to maintain his promise of never losing, he would become the king of hell."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Roronoa Zoro is known for his determination. Since his childhood, Zoro has made it clear that he doesn't care about the opinions of others. He only wants to achieve his goals."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"During his adventures with the Straw Hat Pirates, Zoro had many close run-ins with death. In the Baratie arc, Zoro faced Mihawk and was utterly humiliated by the Shichibukai. Despite the injuries that he suffered, Zoro remained resolute, and he reminded everyone with this quote that if he died, there was no one else to blame."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"In Punk Hazard, the Straw Hats had to face not one but several enemies. They had to fight against Caesar, Smoker, Monet, and Vergo. Monet was actually a member of the Donquixote Pirates, and she was acting as Caesar's assistant."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Throughout his adventure, Luffy has freed many One Piece countries from their oppressors."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"She did not hesitate to attack the kids or any other person who tried to interfere with the work. Monet got too arrogant because of her Devil Fruit ability and attacked Zoro, but the latter was unfazed. He let her know that she was too cavalier and that she should have run when she had the chance."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Even a talented swordsman like Zoro has his limits. In the Albasta arc, Zoro was up against Mr. 1, the second-strongest member of the Baroque Works. Mr. 1 was not an ordinary man. In fact, he had the power of the Supa Supa no Mi. Zoro was struggling to cut through Mr. 1's body with his swords, and if he was unable to beat him, the Straw Hats would be in big trouble."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"So, Zoro looked inward to find the willpower to cut through steel. Mr. 1 was still confident that Zoro wouldn't be able to harm him, but he was proven wrong. The swordsman managed to bypass Mr. 1's rigid body and claimed another scintillating victory."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Considering the number of dangerous characters in the series, it is impossible not to have a run-in with one of them. Zoro suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Dracule Mihawk , and the latter also gave him a massive wound on his torso."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"After fighting Hachi in Arlong Park, Zoro's wound reopened, which caused him to lose his balance. The Fish-Man was pleased to see Zoro fall, but his happiness didn't last for long. Zoro immediately got back up and told his opponent that he would not die until he faced Dracule Mihawk again."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"The Thriller Bark was a fierce test of the determination of the Straw Hat Pirates . They had to take down Oars Jr. together, which required a great deal of effort. The fight took the wind out of everyone's sails, especially Luffy's. However, before the crew could breathe a sigh of relief, Bartholomew Kuma showed up at their location."
https://gamerant.com/one-piece-best-zoro-quotes/,"Kuma would have killed Luffy if not for Zoro's sacrifice. The swordsman first knocked out Sanji, who had also volunteered to take Luffy's pain. With Sanji out of the way, Zoro pushed his hands inside the pain bubble and took in all the damage that Luffy had received. After Sanji woke up, he was shocked to see Zoro covered in blood. When he asked what had happened, Zoro simply replied, ""Nothing happened."" This was one of the most powerful moments in the series."

https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/20376/roronoa-zoros-boasts,"If I die here, then I'm a man that could only make it this far. You need to accept the fact that you're not the best and have all the will to strive to be better than anyone you face. Bring on the hardship. It's preferred in a path of carnage. Either in belief or doubt, if I lean to one of these sides, my reaction time will be dulled if my heart thinks the opposite of what I choose. I don't care what the society says. I've regretted doing anything. I will survive and do what I want to. You want to kill me? You couldn't even kill my boredom! You sure can talk the talk, but you're not quite ready to walk the walk. Time's up, it's my turn. When the world shoves you around, you just gotta stand up and shove back. It's not like somebody's gonna save you if you start babbling excuses. So, are you stupid enough to fall for such a stupid trap that such stupid people set up? I'm a pirate hunter. A wound that'd make an ordinary man unconscious... I won't lose to it. A wound that would kill an ordinary person... I won't lose to it! To face one who is extraordinary, Hawk Eyes... I can't allow myself to be ordinary!

But if I were to take even one step back, I believe that all those important oaths, promises and many other deals 'til now, will all go to waste and I'll never be able to return before you, ever again. So what if you're a girl. If I can't even protect my captain's dream, then whatever ambition I have is nothing but talk... When you decided to go to the sea, it was your own decision. Whatever happens to you on the sea, it depends on what you've done! Don't blame others!! You'll never understand...your swords will never be as heavy as mine! If you do anything that would cause me to abandon my ambitions... You will end your own life on my sword! Fine! I'd rather be a pirate than die here! I am always serious. I do things my own way! So don't give me any lip about it! I'm going to be the world's greatest swordsman! All I have left is my destiny! My name may be infamous...but it's gonna shake the world!!!
