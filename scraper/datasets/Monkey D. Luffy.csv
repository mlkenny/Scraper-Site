https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,"Much like Luffy, Blackbeard believes in the power of dreams. While he may take a villainous approach to his own dreams, one can't help but respect his unwavering will."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,"Dr. Hiriluk may have died before the series ever began, but One Piece fans still love him all the same. Through his wacky personality and beautiful idealism, he was a massive influence on Chopper and was the source behind many of the reindeer's most lovable character traits."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,This quote not only works extremely well in the context of Hiriluk's fate in the anime but also as a beautiful way of thinking about death in real life. Dr. Hiriluk's idea of life brings comfort to any fan who may be going through a difficult time with the passing of a loved one.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,"While many shonen anime portray different types of stories with their own unique themes, some messages transcend their individual anime and become a staple of the genre. Any great battle shonen promotes the idea that hard work and determination are the keys to success and One Piece is no different."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,"While not everything can be overcome with just effort, working hard is still the number one thing that any individual can do regardless of their obstacle's difficulty. This is an ideology that Luffy has lived by his entire life."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,"Chapter one of One Piece has one of the most powerful, story-defining moments in the medium's history. Shanks is an archetypical mentor in many ways, providing Luffy with the motivation and goals that would frame the entire anime. But where Shanks differs from many other badass mentors is his approach toward civility."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,"Despite being one of the most powerful figures in One Piece history and someone that should be feared in most regards, Shanks demonstrates in that first chapter that humility is key and violence is only necessary to protect one's friends."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,"Over the years Luffy has done a lot to solidify himself as one of the most iconic and admirable protagonists in battle shonen history. While many recognize him for his aloof and goofy personality, Luffy is actually defined by his sheer determination and perseverance in becoming the greatest pirate to ever live."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,"Throughout its 1000+ episodes, One Piece has consistently branded itself as a story about fun and adventure, but being whimsical doesn't prevent the anime from occasionally dipping into some profound wisdom. One Piece is an inherently political story that has a lot to say about the world."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-best-quotes/,"These ideas are often embodied by the anime's more radical characters, such as Luffy's father, Dragon. This quote by Dragon has a lot of meaning in today's world, where people are often so driven by greed and power that they're willing to throw away anyone that doesn't serve their goals."

His work, which is both insightful and well-researched, instills confidence in his audience, deepening their engagement and enriching their appreciation."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,Spoilers for the One Piece manga's Elbaph arc.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"It's not an exaggeration to say that meeting Shanks was the most pivotal encounter Luffy has had with a Roger's Pirate so far in Eiichiro Oda's One Piece . But some fans may not appreciate or understand just how monumental their relationship is. It's clear that with recent chapters of One Piece, Oda is hammering how important Shanks is to Luffy. He has even gone out of the way to show Luffy attacking Loki after the latter insulted Shanks' honor."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Shanks molded Luffy into the man he is today, teaching him how to be a pirate and man and imparting a grand legacy onto Luffy as the inheritor of Roger's will. All of this is monumental, which is why it'll make their eventual clash one of tragedy, but before that clash happens, it's best to familiarize oneself with the bond between Red Hair Shanks and Monkey D. Luffy."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Shanks was found by the Roger Pirates after the God Valley Incident and, since then, became an apprentice of Roger's crew, even inheriting the Straw Hat Roger used to wear. Shanks was loyal to the Roger Pirates crew but didn't follow them to Laugh Tale because Buggy, his fellow apprentice and friend, became ill."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Shanks declared he'd visit Laugh Tale in the future, but on Roger's return, Shanks asked Roger a question that burst the young pirate into tears when he got his answers. After Roger's execution and the disbanding of the Roger Pirates, Shanks would start his own pirate crew. At one point, he met his brother, Shamrock , at Mary Geoise, where he renounced his birthright. Shanks' relationship with Rogers is significant as the Straw Hat became an essential treasure to him."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"While One Piece characters like Monkey D. Luffy are known for their bravery, Straw Hats like Usopp and Zoro help redefine exactly what courage means."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Thirteen years before the start of the series, Shanks stole the Gomu Gomu no Mi from a ship being guarded by CP9. Many theories believe Shanks was aware of the Gomu Gomu no Mi's actual name and nature after his adventures on Elbaph and learning about Nika, and specifically hunted down the fruit to give it to Ace , Roger's son, who Roger believed would find the One Piece and surpass him."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Shanks likely believed similarly, having such a fondness for Roger. That is until Shanks met Luffy on Dawn Island by accident. Shanks describes Luffy said something similar to Roger's that practically changed his whole trajectory and made him stay on Dawn Island and Foosha Village for a year."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"In the East Blue, there's a kid saying the exact same thing as Captain Roger! The very same words the Captain said! — Shanks"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Seeing Roger’s will in Luffy, Shanks grew close to him, even celebrating when the boy stabbed himself to prove his worth. However, he refused to let Luffy join his crew because of his inexperience. Shanks’s care deepened after Luffy ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, even sacrificing his arm to protect him. When Shanks left, Luffy vowed to become a pirate, gather a crew, and surpass him as Pirate King. Smiling, Shanks gave Luffy his Straw Hat—a promise that remains unfulfilled."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Luffy sees Shanks as his role model and the Straw Hat as his most critical treasure, and he defends the hat no matter what. This relationship goes both ways, as Shanks is constantly impressed and wowed by Luffy's growth. He discusses him with figures like Whitebeard, Ace, and his former Roger Pirates, Rayleigh and Gaban. Through watching and growing up around Shanks, Luffy was also imparted with tremendous wisdom that turned him into the man he is today."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"For example, Shanks believed that any insult to him didn't matter, even if it resulted in physical pain or perceived humiliation. This is seen when Higuma pours drinks on him in Fooscha Village, while Luffy is at first confused about why Shanks would simply let Higuma have his way with him, but Shanks simply sees Higuma as nothing to get worked up over."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"That is until Higuma threatened Luffy, and Shanks was more than willing to get involved and show Higuma the difference in their power. Luffy carries on this mature mindset by never starting a fight unless a friend's pride or self is hurt. He did the same against Bellamy , who underestimated the Straw Hat, and Tama, who hit and badmouthed Luffy after she was told about Ace's death. Luffy never got mad at her since the insults were about him and not a friend."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"With that reputation, it would seem unlikely for this guy to be waltzing around with words of wisdom, correct? Don't underestimate him."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Shanks made Luffy a wiser man than many give him credit for. He could accurately tell whether someone was evil, understand their most significant obstacle in Alabasta, and make an enemy of the World Government to help Robin understand that he's willing to share her burden. Luffy has always had a knack for understanding others and gauging the best way to approach things emotionally, just like Shanks has."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Some of Luffy's best quotes come from his wisdom fostered by Shanks. Shanks has also taught Luffy how to be a pirate, and while Luffy's approach to freedom seems to be an innate trait, Shanks has continued fostering it by presenting examples of what a pirate should be. Partying and enjoying life with his crew rather than pillaging and harming others for no reason."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"The Straw Hat is one of the most essential accessories in One Piece . And as it was passed down from Rogers to Shanks and now to Luffy, it carries all three's pursuit of freedom. The Straw Hat represents the freedom to pursue one's dreams and a physical representation of Roger's will. Roger passed it onto Shanks to give Shanks the freedom to pursue his dream, and similarly, Shanks is giving Luffy the freedom to pursue his dream, a dream that will see him become the next Joyboy."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"The Straw Hat also represents a ""pirate king's crown."" It's a simple headpiece worn on top of someone's head but made of straw and pauper. Thanks to its connection to Roger, it signifies kingship. Another unique trait of the Straw Hat is its color, as it's as close to gold as a hat can be, and with its dome appearance, it almost looks like a golden sun."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"It perfectly represents Luffy becoming the Sun God as the hat is now more closely associated with him and his crew rather than Shanks or Roger despite them both wearing it. The Straw Hat is the last connection Shanks has to Rogers, which makes the inevitable collision course the two are on even more tragic."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Shanks and Luffy are on a collision course for the One Piece, and they will likely collide either at the location on the final island or on the path there. Luffy did remark that one day, he'd assemble a crew strong enough to take on Shanks and become King of the Pirates, and that moment is coming closer than one may think."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-luffy-shanks-key-connection-influence/,"Shanks goes for the One Piece at the end of Wano and attacks Bartalameo, which proves that he sees Luffy not only as a legitimate pirate but also as a fellow emperor of the sea. The anime series may surprise fans by making Shamrock a figurative battle between Shanks and Luffy, but the real tragedy lies in Luffy facing Shanks himself. He may have to fight his mentor and give up the Straw Hat—the symbol of his dreams and crew. Their clash will be monumental and could become one of One Piece’s greatest battles as the iconic shonen series ultimately comes to a close."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"The world of One Piece is filled to the brim with hundreds of uniquely peculiar characters, but none are more memorable than protagonist Monkey D. Luffy. Over 27 years, he has left an indelible mark on not only the Grand Line but the entire animanga medium, gaining a reputation as one of the most beloved characters in shōnen anime history. More importantly, Luffy's adventures are still ongoing, making him even more relevant today than ever."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Although Monkey D. Luffy isn't always the most eloquent character, he's still spawned a variety of memorable quotes during his time as a pirate. His moral compass and free spirit are much-needed additions to the jaded world of One Piece . And thanks to his well-traveled nature, his words often give life to many of the ideals that the World Government tries to suppress."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Updated on April 24, 2024, by Natasha Elder: Despite seeming like a relatively simple character, Luffy has many inspirational moments throughout One Piece. His determination to do right has resulted in motivational quotes and apt reminders of what's important. As the Egghead arc continues on in animation, we thought it fitting to return to discuss more of Luffy's best quotes, provide accuracy in explaining why this Luffy dialogue is so great, and update imagery to show his best moments."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Since the beginning of One Piece , Luffy has been working toward a singular goal: finding the titular treasure and becoming the King of the Pirates. Despite his focus on personal agency and freedom, even the Straw Hat captain realizes that he cannot accomplish his dreams alone. Luffy very rarely expresses his fear of being unable to become the Pirate King, so this quote hits extremely hard."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Without you, I won't… I can’t become the Pirate King!!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Luffy's heartfelt declaration severely affects Sanji, who breaks into tears, and a sobbing Sanji is completely out of character for him. Then again, it makes complete sense why Luffy would say such a thing, especially with Sanji as his unofficial left-hand man. Having fought together as often as they have, Sanji's assistance is crucial for Luffy finding the One Piece, and, more importantly, Luffy has a deep bond with each of his crewmates . This quote also applies to the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates, all of whom are necessary components of each other's successes."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Every once in a while, a character makes a profound statement that captivates the audience. In One Piece, there's no shortage of inspirational quotes."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Determination is one of the traits that most defines Luffy’s character. While he is often so cheerful it is easy to forget his strength, Luffy becomes quite formidable once he gets serious. This memorable Luffy quote from One Piece: Stampede perfectly sums up his line of thought. He is going to come out on top of anyone that stands between him and his goal to become the King of the Pirates."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"If your goal is to become the King of the Pirates, then I refuse to lose to you!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"This single-minded determination is an important reminder to fully commit to one’s dream. There will always be difficulties in pursuing ambitious goals, whether it comes from direct competition or indirect obstacles. Remaining confident in one’s own ability to overcome these difficulties is paramount in order to eventually succeed. This Luffy quote thus serves as a succinct reminder to not be deterred when encountering opposition ."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Freedom is one of the prime reasons that Luffy wants to become the King of the Pirates. The idea of being free has also defined his relationship with his crewmates. From freeing Zoro from the corrupt Marines to freeing Robin to say she wants to live, Luffy has helped his crewmates escape from their bounds throughout One Piece . That is why this inspirational quote is so fitting for the Straw Hat captain."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"If that's so, try controlling me!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"In One Piece Film: Gold , Gild Tesoro is obsessed with gold due to his tragic experiences as a slave. He believes that gold controls everything and, with his gold-based Devil Fruit, he is the rightful authority. Luffy dares Tesoro to try to control him in response. The context in which this quote is said makes it even better, because it is not only a reminder of autonomy; it is also a reminder that no amount of wealth makes someone better than others. It one’s character that truly defines worth."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Luffy’s final confrontation with Enel takes place during one of the best episodes in the Skypiea arc . This quote is one of the things he shouts at Enel before finally ending the fight for good. While Luffy gets in a lot of confrontations throughout the show, and is not shy to say what he believes, this quote stands out because of the significant context that goes along with it. Beating Enel and ringing the bell doesn’t help just him, the Skypieans, and the Shandia, but also fulfills Mont Blanc Cricket’s dream."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,You're next! I'll ring you along with the bell!
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"The confidence with which Luffy says this quote is truly amazing. Despite all the power that Enel has, Luffy has no doubt that he’ll achieve his goals. More importantly, even in the midst of a life-and-death battle, Luffy is prioritizing his promise to Mont Blanc Cricket. This is how highly Luffy thinks of others’ dreams. By combining his determination to beat Enel with his belief in the dreams of others, Luffy managed to gain even greater strength in his fight."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Luffy believes in his crew to take care of themselves, but that doesn’t mean that he won’t get protective over them. In One Piece Film: Strong World , the antagonist Shiki blackmails Nami into working for him. He has displayed a vast amount of power and a particular disdain for the East Blue. With this combination, he proves to be a significant threat to the ocean that houses Nami’s, Luffy’s, Zoro’s, and Sanji’s family and friends."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,I will never let you touch my crew or the sea for as long as I live!
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"During his final confrontation with Shiki, Luffy loudly proclaims this quote before hitting Shiki so hard that the antagonist mentally compares Luffy to Gol D. Roger . The protection that Luffy displays is admirable. Despite being a pirate, he is determined to save not only his crewmates, but also his home. It is this caring nature that makes Luffy such an endearing protagonist, as well as one that is easy to root for."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"“Give it all you got!” is not exactly a new concept. That doesn’t mean that the quote isn’t still sound advice, though. The Straw Hats often find themselves in situations where giving their all is critical to winning. Luffy in particular leaves it all out on the line when he fights. One of the clearest examples of this is the end of his Thriller Bark arc fight against Gecko Moria, where he collapses after winning because of how hard he battled."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Alright, you guys! Give it all you've got!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"In One Piece Film: Red , the Straw Hat Pirates and the Red Hair Pirates work together to save Shanks’ daughter, Uta. It is a combined crew effort, and both Luffy and Shanks encourage their crews with the same “give it all you got” sentiment. Sometimes, simplicity is all that is needed to fire up others. Additionally, a tried-and-true inspirational quote like this one has stood the test of time for a reason: it succinctly conveys the right motivation."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,Monkey D. Luffy and the rest of the Straw Hat crew have impactful quotes that show fans who they are.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"During his fight with Charlotte Katakuri, Luffy finds it very difficult to counter his opponent's Observation Haki. Katakuri is capable of Future Vision, allowing him to dodge or bypass Luffy's attacks, at least until the Straw Hat himself begins developing the same ability. Unfortunately, Katakuri is far too strong and easily pummels the hero into near-unconsciousness."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"At one point, Luffy collapses on the ground, which is when Katakuri reveals that the Big Mom Pirates know about the Straw Hats' rendezvous point on Cacao Island. For his part, Luffy casually comments that his crew believes in him, or rather his ability to come out victorious, shocking Katakuri. In this simple quote, Luffy expresses just how much he trusts the Straw Hats and vice-versa. No matter how tough the situation can get, the Straw Hats know that Luffy can surpass it."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Flags are symbolic of power in One Piece , which is why Luffy consistently defends the Drum Kingdom flag designed by Dr. Hiriluk, Chopper's mentor and father figure. Meanwhile, the tyrannical King Wapol attempts to seize his former kingdom once again, only for the Straw Hats to prevent him from doing so. Wapol engages Luffy in battle, who remains more or less unaffected by the former King's attacks."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,I don't care if you're a king or not. There are things that matter more than power.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"At the same time, he orders Wapol not to touch Dr. Hiriluk's flag, stating that his kingship matters less than the safety and happiness of his people. This quote demonstrates not only Luffy's determination to defeat any oppressors but also his philosophy surrounding power. Luffy doesn't seek strength because he wants to be the strongest ; he knows that power only has value when it's used in defense of the oppressed. It's easy to imagine Luffy sacrificing all his power to save his friends, even if it means losing his dreams."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Pirates and other polarizing figures aren’t the only groups to have meaningful flags. It's clear that the World Government's Flag carries the most innate authority in One Piece . The Marines fiercely defend their employers against pirates, but many of them also cause harm to innocent citizens. Luffy innately recognizes the dangers posed by the World Government, although he expresses his indignation indirectly in most cases."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,Sogeking... Shoot down that flag.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"In Ennies Lobby, the Straw Hat captain effectively declares war on the World Government by ordering Usopp to destroy its flag. This moment was extra impactful because Usopp, whose cowardice would have otherwise prevented him from taking such risks, gladly obeyed Luffy's command. The Marines watching the scene were shocked at the Straw Hats' audacity, but Luffy had already forgotten about the flag and shifted his attention to Robin by that point."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"During the Marineford War in One Piece , Luffy was extremely confident that he could save his brother Ace from execution. And yet, no matter how fiercely he fought, he was ultimately heartbroken when Ace sacrificed his life to save Luffy. The Straw Hat captain rapidly fell into a catatonic state upon his brother's death, leaving his allies to rescue him from the battlefield. Jinbe managed to deliver Luffy to Law's submarine before taking him to Amazon Lily."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-anime-luffy-quotes/,"Luffy's self-pitying behavior during his recovery was admonished by Jinbe. Luffy reacts by trying to start a fight, but Jinbe shuts that down instantly. The future helmsman of the Straw Hats helps Luffy understand that he has not lost everything. This finally reminds Luffy that his beloved friends—nakama without whom he could never sail the Grand Line—are still around. This is also the quote that inspires Luffy to get stronger, leading to the two-year time skip."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"One Piece is packed with not just cool worldbuilding and exciting fight scenes, but also some incredible dialogue to bring all these characters and their world to life. Dialogue is often the best way for characters to express themselves and comment on the world they live in, and the best quotes will stick in viewers' minds for many years to come."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"One Piece may have plenty of cheap and silly dialogue, such as shouting attack names or friendly banter, but the dialogue isn't all fluff. In every story arc, the best One Piece characters will have something profound or meaningful to say, which often encapsulates exactly who these characters are and what they stand for."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Protagonist Monkey D. Luffy might blurt out a lot of nonsense in One Piece , but he's not as foolish as his worst dialogue would suggest. Luffy puts more thought into his adventure and his life than many other One Piece characters give him credit for, and his dialogue reflects this. His best quotes also stem from his practical, go-getter ESTP personality type."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Luffy is always working toward the future, and even if he's not a crafty schemer or meticulous planner, he has the right attitude to seize his destiny and make something of himself. Planning and strategy are great, but action and confidence are what turn dreams into reality so a person, pirate or not, can unlock the future they want."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"- Sanji Vinsmoke, Chapter 854"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Luffy's chef and crewmate Sanji Vinsmoke often acts self-centered in One Piece , from seeking out the All Blue for his own culinary purposes to chasing after women for his own pleasure. Rarely does Sanji show any sympathy or emotionally support others, but if he meets the right people, he will show them kindness after all."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Sanji's quote about starving people proved that for a tough guy like him, it takes personal experience for Sanji to truly connect with someone and understand their hardships. This harkens back to Sanji's rough experience on that chunk of rock with Zeff, where they nearly died of starvation, and it helps explain why Sanji detests wasting food."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,Bring on the hardship. It's preferred in a path of carnage.

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Roronoa Zoro the swordsman has a tough-guy persona, and he often speaks in terse, harsh ways to express himself and what he thinks of others. This means Zoro has some of the best and coolest dialogue among One Piece 's main characters, including his quote about living a life of challenges and hardship."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Zoro knows that as a pirate serving the future pirate king, his career will be filled with deadly challenges.

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Trying to pay Arlong's debt Nami was always shackled to her home town. After Luffy freed her, she was able to truly explore the world without guilt or pain. A life can be either spent or wasted, but will end regardless, so Nami believes people can and should spend their lives creating something incredible and make their limited time mean something."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Even if there are billows of smoke, we can still see the sky. We can still see the ocean! It ain't like it's hell here! So don't act like you're about to die!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Like his captain Luffy, Usopp the sniper king has plenty of goofy and forgettable dialogue, and he's also prone to telling tall tales , hence his big nose. However, Usopp also has some heartfelt things to say, usually to help motivate his crew and show what a wonderful, caring person he is."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Usopp's line about not acting like someone is about to die is a fairly standard shonen sentiment, but it still means a lot. No one, certainly not a Straw Hat, should give up before they die and deny themselves one last chance to fight back. If someone has lost in their mind, then they will definitely lose on the outside, too."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Tony Tony Chopper the reindeer made his debut in the Drum Island story arc, as the disciple of the late Dr. Hiriluk and an associate of Dr. Kureha's. Chopper ate a Devil Fruit to be more human, including talking and walking upright, but when he met Luffy, Chopper wasn't afraid to be his original self."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Chopper found acceptance and validation with Luffy's crew, so he no longer tried so hard to hide his monster side. Chopper felt free to use his Rumble Balls to become a great shaggy beast who can pummel his enemies for Luffy's sake, and that kind of self-acceptance means a lot coming from an animal who rejects being his actual species."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"You know, kid, laughter is the key to happiness. When you’re happy, you laugh. So it follows that you’ll become happy when you laugh… Try laughing. When times are tough, just laugh!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Nico Robin is a clever, independent-minded kuudere who joined the Straw Hat crew as the Alabasta arc ended. For a time, Robin kept her true feelings and past life to herself as a mysterious Straw Hat, but eventually, One Piece fans learned the truth. Nico Robin had been through a lot, and it almost broke her."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Robin was ready to give up and handed herself over to the World Government at Enies Lobby to save her friends, but then she was inspired to survive after all.

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"The cyborg shipbuilder Franky, like Luffy and Usopp, tends to have a lot of silly dialogue for the sake of comic relief throughout One Piece . Still, Franky can be serious if he sees fit, such as his quote to Nico Robin in the Water 7 saga 's climax at Enies Lobby."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Franky's line was most resonant for Nico Robin, who felt like a criminal just for being a well-read scholar from Ohara, but it can apply to anyone. Even if someone has made past mistakes or comes from a rough place, their past does not make them a bad person, and they can always find new ways to validate themselves in the present."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,Being dead is never an apology.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Brook the musical skeleton often talked about death and bones for obvious reasons, sometimes for humor's sake and sometimes to say something profound. Brook has a unique view on death and the afterlife, having already died once, and he's determined to not glamorize death for any reason."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Brook highly values life and can't stand it when people choose to embrace death instead. For example, Brook noted that a person's death cannot make things right, and a person cannot make up for their past wrongs by ending their lives. Death won't erase what happened, and even if the dead person's enemies are satisfied, it's an empty satisfaction."

Then Ace grew up and embarked on his pirating adventure, and he only saw Luffy a few more times until his death. But even if the brothers were often kept apart, their bond remained strong."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"During the climax of the Summit War saga at Marineford, Ace suffered a mortal blow and knew he didn't have long. So, he held Luffy one more time and said what always meant to say: to thank Luffy for being his loving brother.
