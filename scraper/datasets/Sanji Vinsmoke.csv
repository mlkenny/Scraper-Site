https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"Vinsmoke Sanji , of One Piece , is a well-loved character of the Straw Hat Pirates. The love-stricken cook will gladly do anything to protect his crew and any women in need, which means your days are numbered, they're threatened."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,RELATED: Naruto: 5 Times We Hated Sakura (& 5 Times We Loved Her)
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"Sanji’s jovial spirit for his crew members, the ladies, and food, are often executed quite well into words. Whether it’s a tense situation or a comical moment, Sanji always knows the right words to say. Here are the 10 best quotes by Sanji."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"Sanji’s chivalry toward women, knows no bounds, even if it’s the enemy. During the Punk Hazard arc, Tashigi is having a difficult time breathing and Vergo is seconds away from finishing her off. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Sanji airwalks his way to her rescue. Given the fact Tashigi is a Marine, should he be really assisting her? Moreover, she’s Smoker second in command. Regardless, even if she’s the enemy, she’s a woman in need."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"While the rest of his crew members have been captured by Crocodile, Sanji is the only one that’s still mobile. The reason being, no Baroque Works member has ever seen Sanji. However, Crocodile does recognize his voice while on the Transponder Snail. He spoke with the cook, back on Little Garden. Sanji gives him the name Mr.Prince. This name is so fitting seeing that it matches his chivalrous personality."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"These are words Sanji utters while fighting Mr.2, otherwise known as Bon Clay. Bon Clay has the Devil Fruit ability to change his appearance. He uses this ability to take advantage of Sanji, by turning into Usopp. Sanji isn't convinced and kicks him anyway. Mr.2 is enthralled that Sanji would attack one of his close friend, but according to Sanji, he may look like Usopp, but he doesn’t have his heart."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"Zoro and Sanji are one of the first to meet each other, after the two years they are apart. Upon them running into each other, Sanji tells Zoro not to go anywhere, since he has a habit of getting lost. He also refers to him as “Moss Head,” in order to criticize his green hair. The two eventually start arguing like they always do. One would think Zoro and Sanji would move past this rivalry, after two years."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"Sanji’s sister, Reiju, wonders how he grew to become so respectable of women. Sanji then reflects when he was a child on the Baratie. He and the rest of the cooks ask Zefe to hire a female chef."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,RELATED: One Piece: 10 Pirates Who Have Been In More Than One Crew
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"He refuses to do so, seeing that he has a violent method of teaching his employees how to cook. He then tells his employees how they should never hit a woman, under any circumstances. Young Sanji claims Zefe is a bit of a fool for thinking this way. Zefe claims not hitting women is something that men knew back in the age of the dinosaurs. When he's done reflecting, Sanji then tells Reiju, “That’s a tradition from the age of the dinosaurs."""
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"During one of the best filler arcs in One Piece, G-8, Sanji disguises himself as one of the cooks on the Marine Base . He somehow gets into a cooking competition with the other cooks. The cooks are given some of the finest and expensive ingredients to cook with. Sanji, however, notices how wasteful the cooks are with their remains. He then uses these remains to make a proper meal. He explains to the other Marine chefs when on a ship, one must never waste food. It doesn’t matter how expensive the meat is, you should use everything on it, even the bones."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"Sanji’s eldest brother, Ichiji, disrespects the head female chef, by not completely eating his food, criticizing it, and throwing it on the floor. Sanji becomes enraged by his behavior, obviously."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"The Straw Hat cook knows what it's like to be deprived of food, seeing that he and Zefe, were stranded for days without it. Sanji calls his brother a brat for being inconsiderate towards the cook. He doesn’t know how hard that woman and her staff worked to prepare their meal. Furthermore, he doesn’t know how valuable food is since he has never missed a meal."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"Sanji says this after he uses his infamous Flambage Shot against CP9’ s Jyabara. This quote resonates with many fans because Sanji doesn’t just mean this when he fights, he means this while he cooks, as well. Sanji is very passionate about cooking; it gives him a rather holy feeling. When he uses spices, however, it’s a bit of a walk on the wild side, hence why he believes they're a gift from the devil."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"After being stranded without food for days on end, Sanji vows he will never deny anyone food, even an enemy. Gin, Combat Commander of the Krieg Pirates is denied food because of his reputation, at the Baratie. Gin even offers to pay for the meal. They still tell him no and throw him out. Sanji makes him a meal anyway. At first, the Krieg Pirate rebukes the gesture, seeing it as a charity. Sanji basically tells him to swallow his pride. He later laments to Gin that he knows how it feels to be deprived of food. It’s something hard to endure. Gin comes to his senses and passionately eats the meal. He later thanks Sanji for the noble act. Luffy took notice of this and decides then he wants Sanji to be his cook on the Merry."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-best-sanji-quotes/,"These words hit harder than any other of the quotes on this list. Sanji says this at the end of this very episode where he is first introduced. This introduction of him lets the viewer or reader know what kind of person Sanji is. He does not tolerate disrespect from anyone, regardless of their status. The guy that he says this to is a lieutenant of the Marines who goes by the name Fullbody. After feeling disrespected by Sanji, he decides to make a scene by criticizing his meal and later throwing it on the ground. Seeing that the future Straw Hat Chef is abhorrent about people wasting food, he pummels him. You never disrespect a cook on the sea. It's essential to your survival."

https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,Love and friendship often play positive roles in One Piece .

https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"However, love can also cause agony. Several times throughout the story, characters experience severe pain by losing their loved ones or by trying to protect them. Their relationships can land the characters in dicey and precarious situations where much is at risk, or cause them to feel intense emotions."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"When Arlong invades Cocoyashi Village, he murders Belle-Mere, forces Nami into his crew, and makes a deal. If she can collect 100,000 berries, she can buy her beloved villagers' lives from him. This leads to years of Nami stashing money to reach her intended goal."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"Nami feels grief after losing Belle-Mere, keeping her plan secret, working for Arlong, and backstabbing the Straw Hats to take their ship. In the end, it is all rendered pointless when Arlong cheats to confiscate her money, and the villagers charge to their certain deaths. After everything she has suffered, Nami collapses and removes her Arlong-given tattoo until Luffy intervenes to stop her ."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"In a case of tragic loyalty, the West Blue baby whale Laboon follows his friends, the Rumbar Pirates, into the Grand Line.

https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"Despite the Rumbar Pirates' demise and Crocus sternly informing him that his friends won't return, Laboon refuses to listen. Under the belief that the Red Line is preventing his reunion with his friends, Laboon regularly injures himself on the Red Line by ramming it, causing extensive physical scarring. Sadly, Laboon's love for his friends hurt him."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"After operating against Alabasta from the shadows for years, Crocodile makes himself publicly known for the final battle. With his sand abilities and Baroque Works cronies, he is practically unstoppable. The dire situation inspires the Royal Guards to take matters into their own hands and drink Hero Water."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"Hero Water grants superhuman strength in battle, but at the cost of severely shortening the drinker's life span. Vivi is aghast at their actions because of their love for their country. In mockery, Crocodile takes himself out of reach to wait them out. It guarantees that he won't need to fight the Royal Guards since they will expire anyway. As salt in the wound, this unwavering love for their country also deprives them of a noble death."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"In Nico Robin's backstory, her island Ohara was destroyed by the World Government after its historians began researching the Void Century. Since Robin was young, she could have escaped the Marines who were rounding up Ohara's historians."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"However, seeing her mother, Nico Olvia, for the first time in years was more than Robin could bear. Olvia tried to protect Robin by denying their relationship and claiming not to recognize her. Desperate for Olvia's acknowledgment, Robin blurted out her historian credentials. This alerted the present Marines to Robin's status. Though Robin was able to embrace Olvia, it also painted a target on her back for the future."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"In the past, Tom built Gol D. Roger's ship. This originally counted as a crime against him since he aided a pirate. When he is falsely brought to task for attacking Water 7, courtesy of Spandam, Tom lets his creation of the Sea Train absolve him of the crime. However, takes the blame for building the Oro Jackson."

When Franky rejects his ""Battle Frankies"" for attacking Water 7, Tom makes a violent scene and chastises him for denying his creations. He tells him that a ship is a ship and to always be proud of what he makes, regardless of how succeeding owners use it."

She asks Iceberg to repair her enough to make the journey to Enies Lobby and arrives just as the Straw Hats are about to fall to the Marines."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"Though she whisks them away, Merry starts to fall apart beneath them before they return to Water 7. With help from the Franky Gang and Galley-La members, the Straw Hats give Merry a final farewell and honorable burial at sea. The Straw Hats are all clearly emotional or on the verge of sobbing as they watch their precious ship burn."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"Gecko Moria isn't the most sympathetic character, which his trap for passersby in Thriller Bark and his partnership with Dr. Hogback shows. Still, the anime manages some shred of sympathy and understanding for his character when his backstory is shared. In the past, Moria led the Gecko Pirates. They were all loyal to him, and he cared about them."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"That changed when Moria's crew met Kaido. He slaughtered them all, taking away both Moria's underlings and friends.

With the staunch and heated declaration that the era belongs to Whitebeard, Ace is frustratingly baited into fighting Akainu and then putting himself in harm's way to save Luffy. His death is horrifying, but more annoyingly, caused by love."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"Fish-Man Island has a bloody past for its royalty. Queen Otohime, aware of the strong discrimination between Fish-Men and humans, lobbied for peace and understanding between the two. While her intentions and principles were honorable, Otohime was killed by Hody Jones . Hody hated humans and framed one for her death to ensure the mutual enmity continued."
https://www.cbr.com/times-love-destroyed-one-piece-heroes/,"Deeply aggrieved at his beloved wife's murder, Neptune kept himself locked away to mourn Otohime. It also kept him in check since he admitted that Otohime's death made him want to kill humans, the same species as her supposed murderer."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"When a series has been running as long as One Piece , it's bound to have a treasure trove of memorable moments ready to be plundered. What sets One Piece apart from most other long-running anime is consistency. Looking back throughout the years and its numerous arcs, there are iconic moments in every single canon story arc – from Luffy setting Zoro free to his epic showdown against Kaido."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"There are currently 32 story arcs in One Piece . As the Wano Arc comes to a close and the final One Piece saga is about to begin, there's never been a better time to look back at some of the best moments in the iconic One Piece series."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"Netflix's One Piece did a fantastic job with the East Blue, so fans can't wait to see what the live-action has in store for the Alabasta saga."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"During Episode 2, ""Enter the Great Swordsman! Pirate Hunter Roronoa Zoro!,"" Zoro appears in Orange Town tied to a Cross. Rika, a young villager from Orange Town, feels sorry for Zoro, offering him rice balls. Zoro knows the danger she's unintentionally putting herself in by approaching a criminal with food. In an attempt to get her to leave, Zorro speaks to her harshly. Unfortunately, a group of low-level marines approach Zoro while she's there."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"After trying a rice ball, Helmeppo spits it out, then knocks the other one to the ground, crushing them into the ground before leaving. Following this brief encounter, Luffy approaches Zoro. Zoro asks Luffy to feed him the now muddied rice balls. This moment highlighted Zoro's character. He's someone who wouldn't want to waste food and wants to respect Rika's effort. Rika lights up later on when Luffy tells her Zorro ate every last bit."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"During the first episode of the Orange Town arc, ""Luffy's Past! Enter Red-Haired Shanks!,"" Luffy is kidnapped by a group of Bandits and taken out to sea. Shanks pursues them not long after and rescues Luffy. Suddenly, a Sea King appears and immediately lunges towards Luffy."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"Shanks intervenes, saving Luffy from the Sea King's attack. As Luffy wells up, Shanks tells him not to cry. The next moment, viewers learn that Shanks lost an arm while protecting Luffy. When they return to land, Shanks gives Luffy his iconic Straw Hat. The moment is brief but is one of the most defining scenes in all of One Piece . The straw hat represents what it means to be a pirate to Luffy. By protecting Luffy, Shanks taught him that pirates protect their crew and the people close to them, and the straw hat symbolizes that moment."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"The World Government in One Piece uses different types of justice, ranging from humane to dictatorial – blurring the lines of right and wrong."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"The Syrup Village arc's best scene occurs when Usopp paints the Straw Hat's Jolly Roger flag for their ship, Going Merry. This flag is symbolic of Usopp's relationship with pirates, as well as how he and Luffy are bound together by their connection to Shanks. While Usopp's parents are no longer with him as his mom passed away from a long-term illness when he was child and his Dad is part of Shank's Red Hair Pirates, he now shares a familial bond with the Straw Hats."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"The Going Merry was gifted to the Straw Hat Pirates by Usopp's closest friend, Kaya, after defeating the Black Cat Pirates. For him, their Jolly Roger and the Going Merry hold great significance. Usopp believes pirates can achieve anything, including finding a miracle medicine that could have cured his dying mother.

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"During the final episode of the Baratie Arc, ""Set Sail! The Seafaring Cook Sets off With Luffy!,"" Sanji is overwhelmed with emotion, and bows in front of Zeff, the owner of the Baratie ship and the person who took him in. Sanji, Zeff, and the Baratie cooks all begin to cry, as Sanji explains how much they all mean to him. To Sanji, the Baratie crew are his family, and performing a dogeza bow (the strongest way of showing respect in Japanese culture), was his way of showing how much he cares for them."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"Sanji had a traumatic childhood and leaving his new family was a scary decision for him, even if he would never openly admit it. The moment Sanji performed this bow, it marked his transition from being a cook on the Baratie to someone who was about to embark on an adventure to achieve his dream and find the All Blue. The child who was rejected by the Vinsmokes, now has a dream and two families who care for him."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"When Nami first sets sail aboard the Going Merry , her goal is to steal enough money to buy back her hometown, Cocoyasi Village, from the villainous Arlong.

Humiliated and devastated, Nami breaks down and begins to repeatedly stab her Arlong Pirates tattoo while shouting Arlong's name."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"At this moment, Luffy appears to stop her. She tries to reject him, but Luffy already considers Nami his friend and refuses to leave. Feeling hopeless, Nami turns to Luffy and tearfully asks him to help her. In a touching gesture, Luffy places his hat on Nami's head, Nami is stunned because she knows what this hat means to him. Luffy then takes off with the rest of the Straw Hats to confront Arlong. This powerful and iconic moment signified Luffy's unwavering determination to protect his nakama."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"With heartwarming moments, epic battles, and intense power scaling, One Piece is filled with revolutionary scenes that greatly impacted shonen anime."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"During the Loguetown Arc, the Straw Hat Pirates share their life ambitions as they prepare to leave the East Blue and set sail towards the Grand Line . The Straw Hats, standing in the rain, each place one foot on a porthole and share their life ambitions."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"Luffy declares he will become King of the Pirates, Zoro strives to become the strongest swordsman in the world, Usopp wants to become a brave warrior of the sea, Sanji dreams of finding the All Blue, and Nami wants to draw a map of the entire world. This scene beautifully illustrates that while they may all have different ambitions, they wholeheartedly support each other as a tightly-knit crew. No matter the weather, they face it together."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"Following their departure from Loguetown, the Straw Hats cross Reverse Mountain, where, much like the name suggests, water flows upwards and over the mountain. Suddenly, a colossal whale appears, blocking the Straw Hat Pirates' path. All of the crew members, including the typically fearless Zoro, look terrified as a colossal whale called Laboon towers over them. While everyone else is freaking out about the sudden appearance of this gigantic creature, Luffy is furious that the whale has caused his favorite seat to be destroyed."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"Luffy seizes this opportunity to confront the gigantic whale head-on, punching it square in the eye. The whale, surprisingly unfazed, looks down as Zoro and Usopp, bemused and exasperated, promptly kick Luffy to the ground while calling him an idiot. Following their departure from Loguetown, the East Blue Saga comes to a close, marking the start of the Arabasta Saga with the brief 2-episode Reverse Mountain Arc. From this point onward, the Straw Hat Pirates' encounters become progressively weirder and more formidable, setting the stage for the adventures that lie ahead."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"In Episode 66, ""All Out Battle! Luffy vs. Zoro! Mysterious Grand Duel!,"" Luffy and Zoro end up fighting each other . Impressively, Zoro manages to hold his own against Luffy, he even causes a powerful blast of air that sends Luffy flying into the distance. Of course, Luffy, being made of rubber, can compensate for huge distances by extending his limbs to land a blow on Zoro."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"At this point, they have unintentionally but humorously knocked out two of the nearby numbered agents, and it's only when Nami comes along and smacks them on the head that they stop fighting. During their time in Whiskey Peak, they encounter the first members of Crocodile's number gang that similarly provide standout moments with their wacky and humorous powers, such as Miss Wednesday, Mr. 9, Mr. 5, and Miss Monday."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"In the Diary of Koby-Meppo Arc, Garp is impressed with Koby and Helmeppo's willingness to risk their lives, so he decides to take them under his care and train them. These two episodes, although they may feel like filler, are actually part of the canon story, lasting only two episodes. They primarily focus on Koby and Helmeppo. In this arc, they have grown older and joined the Marines with the hope of becoming influential navy figures, aiming to change the world for the better."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"Their optimism takes a hit when they realize that the Marines include numerous corrupt and ill-intentioned individuals, making their experience disheartening and fear-inducing. However, a glimmer of hope emerges as Garp, who has been discreetly observing Koby and Helmeppo from a distant ship, acknowledges their courage and determination, leading to his decision to mentor and train them."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"The Straw Hat Pirates have faced tough times on more than one occasion and despite being more than a family, they've had to lose a bunch of members."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"The best moment in the Little Garden Arc may be its most curious: Miss Goldenweek's power. While Luffy is fighting Mr. 3 , Miss. Goldenweek's unique power, Colors Trap, begins to weave its influence. Shockingly, Luffy uncharacteristically says in Episode 75, ""What should I do? I don't feel like saving you guys,"" as Zoro and Nami are slowly enveloped in wax. The camera switches its focus from Luffy to Miss Goldenweek as she reveals her power."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-arc-higlights/,"This moment is particularly fantastic as it explores how a character's mental state can be influenced by unique special abilities. In the case of Miss Goldenweek, she can profoundly influence a character's emotions by painting different colored symbols. What makes this moment even more amazing is that, unlike most other One Piece characters with special abilities, Miss Goldenweek does not possess a Devil Fruit. Sadly, nothing has been mentioned in the series that would explain how abilities outside of Devil Fruits can exist."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"One Piece is packed with not just cool worldbuilding and exciting fight scenes, but also some incredible dialogue to bring all these characters and their world to life. Dialogue is often the best way for characters to express themselves and comment on the world they live in, and the best quotes will stick in viewers' minds for many years to come."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"One Piece may have plenty of cheap and silly dialogue, such as shouting attack names or friendly banter, but the dialogue isn't all fluff. In every story arc, the best One Piece characters will have something profound or meaningful to say, which often encapsulates exactly who these characters are and what they stand for."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Protagonist Monkey D. Luffy might blurt out a lot of nonsense in One Piece , but he's not as foolish as his worst dialogue would suggest. Luffy puts more thought into his adventure and his life than many other One Piece characters give him credit for, and his dialogue reflects this. His best quotes also stem from his practical, go-getter ESTP personality type."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Luffy is always working toward the future, and even if he's not a crafty schemer or meticulous planner, he has the right attitude to seize his destiny and make something of himself. Planning and strategy are great, but action and confidence are what turn dreams into reality so a person, pirate or not, can unlock the future they want."

https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Luffy's chef and crewmate Sanji Vinsmoke often acts self-centered in One Piece , from seeking out the All Blue for his own culinary purposes to chasing after women for his own pleasure. Rarely does Sanji show any sympathy or emotionally support others, but if he meets the right people, he will show them kindness after all."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Sanji's quote about starving people proved that for a tough guy like him, it takes personal experience for Sanji to truly connect with someone and understand their hardships. This harkens back to Sanji's rough experience on that chunk of rock with Zeff, where they nearly died of starvation, and it helps explain why Sanji detests wasting food."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,Bring on the hardship. It's preferred in a path of carnage.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"- Roronoa Zoro, Episode 300"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Roronoa Zoro the swordsman has a tough-guy persona, and he often speaks in terse, harsh ways to express himself and what he thinks of others. This means Zoro has some of the best and coolest dialogue among One Piece 's main characters, including his quote about living a life of challenges and hardship."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Zoro knows that as a pirate serving the future pirate king, his career will be filled with deadly challenges. Instead of fearing that hardship, Zoro embraces it all as a chance to grow stronger and prove himself. Zoro understands that no one, warrior or not, improves themselves when they're comfortable."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"One Piece's universe holds many secrets, and the World Government likes it that way – leaving many citizens clueless about the world they live in."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,In order to draw a map of the world.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Nami was always fascinated by maps, and she vowed to become a great cartographer who would draw a map of the entire world. Now, Nami can realize that lofty dream as Luffy's navigator, and she applies this philosophy to life in general."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Trying to pay Arlong's debt Nami was always shackled to her home town. After Luffy freed her, she was able to truly explore the world without guilt or pain. A life can be either spent or wasted, but will end regardless, so Nami believes people can and should spend their lives creating something incredible and make their limited time mean something."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Even if there are billows of smoke, we can still see the sky. We can still see the ocean! It ain't like it's hell here! So don't act like you're about to die!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Like his captain Luffy, Usopp the sniper king has plenty of goofy and forgettable dialogue, and he's also prone to telling tall tales , hence his big nose. However, Usopp also has some heartfelt things to say, usually to help motivate his crew and show what a wonderful, caring person he is."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Usopp's line about not acting like someone is about to die is a fairly standard shonen sentiment, but it still means a lot. No one, certainly not a Straw Hat, should give up before they die and deny themselves one last chance to fight back. If someone has lost in their mind, then they will definitely lose on the outside, too."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"With declarations of war, and significant timeskips, One Piece plotlines rank among the best that shonen anime has to offer."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"I realized that back then, the reason I wanted to become human, was that I really just wanted to have friends. Now, I just want to be a monster that can help Luffy."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"- Tony Tony Chopper, Episode 81"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Tony Tony Chopper the reindeer made his debut in the Drum Island story arc, as the disciple of the late Dr. Hiriluk and an associate of Dr. Kureha's. Chopper ate a Devil Fruit to be more human, including talking and walking upright, but when he met Luffy, Chopper wasn't afraid to be his original self."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Chopper found acceptance and validation with Luffy's crew, so he no longer tried so hard to hide his monster side. Chopper felt free to use his Rumble Balls to become a great shaggy beast who can pummel his enemies for Luffy's sake, and that kind of self-acceptance means a lot coming from an animal who rejects being his actual species."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"You know, kid, laughter is the key to happiness. When you’re happy, you laugh. So it follows that you’ll become happy when you laugh… Try laughing. When times are tough, just laugh!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Nico Robin is a clever, independent-minded kuudere who joined the Straw Hat crew as the Alabasta arc ended. For a time, Robin kept her true feelings and past life to herself as a mysterious Straw Hat, but eventually, One Piece fans learned the truth. Nico Robin had been through a lot, and it almost broke her."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Robin was ready to give up and handed herself over to the World Government at Enies Lobby to save her friends, but then she was inspired to survive after all. Nico Robin's emotional resilience is expressed well in her quote about hard times, since laughter is indeed the best medicine. It can refresh the mind and give someone the resolve and willpower to face their hardships once again."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Vegeta is one of the most iconic characters in the Dragon Ball franchise, and some of his best lines can be found in Dragon Ball Super."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"The government says your existence is a crime, but no matter what kind of weapons you may hold, just being alive isn't a sin! There's no crime in living!"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"The cyborg shipbuilder Franky, like Luffy and Usopp, tends to have a lot of silly dialogue for the sake of comic relief throughout One Piece . Still, Franky can be serious if he sees fit, such as his quote to Nico Robin in the Water 7 saga 's climax at Enies Lobby."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Franky's line was most resonant for Nico Robin, who felt like a criminal just for being a well-read scholar from Ohara, but it can apply to anyone. Even if someone has made past mistakes or comes from a rough place, their past does not make them a bad person, and they can always find new ways to validate themselves in the present."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,Being dead is never an apology.
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Brook the musical skeleton often talked about death and bones for obvious reasons, sometimes for humor's sake and sometimes to say something profound. Brook has a unique view on death and the afterlife, having already died once, and he's determined to not glamorize death for any reason."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Brook highly values life and can't stand it when people choose to embrace death instead. For example, Brook noted that a person's death cannot make things right, and a person cannot make up for their past wrongs by ending their lives. Death won't erase what happened, and even if the dead person's enemies are satisfied, it's an empty satisfaction."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"- Portgas D. Ace, Episode 483"
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Luffy's brother, Portgas D. Ace, didn't get much familial love growing up in the Goa Kingdom, so instead, he embraced Sabo and Luffy as his brothers. Then Ace grew up and embarked on his pirating adventure, and he only saw Luffy a few more times until his death. But even if the brothers were often kept apart, their bond remained strong."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"During the climax of the Summit War saga at Marineford, Ace suffered a mortal blow and knew he didn't have long. So, he held Luffy one more time and said what always meant to say: to thank Luffy for being his loving brother. That allowed Ace to pass in peace, and he even died with a smile on his face, as per the Will of D ."
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,Mayumi Tanaka Monkey D. Luffy (voice)
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,Kazuya Nakai Roronoa Zoro (voice)
https://www.cbr.com/one-piece-mc-quotes/,"Follows the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his pirate crew in order to find the greatest treasure ever left by the legendary Pirate, Gold Roger. The famous mystery treasure named ""One Piece""."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"One Piece stands as one of the best Shonen anime series of all time, but despite the cohesiveness of its narrative, the series isn't one giant story arc. This franchise is almost like an anthology, taking Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat crew on various adventures all over their fictional world. As a result, One Piece 's journey is often divided into sagas, each of which is broken up into shorter story arcs."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"A One Piece story arc generally encompasses the overarching narrative that takes place on a single island (with a few notable exceptions). The One Piece anime has dozens of canonical story arcs, with the Egghead Island arc having just come out of hiatus. Although all One Piece arcs are enjoyable, some have proven their superiority thanks to fantastic world-building, incredible action sequences, intriguing plot development and unique, memorable moments."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Updated on May 14, 2025, by Ajay Aravind: Now that the One Piece manga has already entered the Elbaph arc, it's only a matter of time before the Straw Hats find the location of Laugh Tale and the One Piece. The One Piece anime has also begun airing new Egghead episodes, with the most recent one released on May 4, 2025. While the narrative might need a few more storylines before it comes to an end, there are more than enough arcs available to rank. As such, we have updated this list with five more of the best One Piece arcs."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"The New World is home to the Grand Line's strongest and most notorious pirates, so it follows suit that the Straw Hat Pirates would encounter some of their toughest challenges in this part of the sea. However, even their wildest dreams couldn't have prepared Luffy's crew for the mystical island of Zou. Unlike other islands that the Straw Hat Pirates visit, Zou doesn't technically reside on the Grand Line; instead, the location can be found on the back of the giant, ocean-traversing elephant."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"As One Piece dives into its major antagonistic faction, the World Government, the group's hierarchy should be fresh in fans' minds."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Zunesha makes Zou one of the most unique locations in all of One Piece — a claim that is significantly bolstered by the fact that Zunesha and Joy Boy were familiar with each other. Altogether, Zou isn't as interesting as the rest of the arcs in the New World, explaining its ranking at the bottom of this list. On an important note, however, this is when Sanji leaves the Straw Hats for Whole Cake Island."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"The most important turning point after the Straw Hats' two-year hiatus wasn't at Sabaody Archipelago, but the location they were most eager to get to next. Reaching the New World would have been impossible without going through Fish-Man Island, and the Straw Hats could also reunite with allies like Camie and former enemies like Hatchan. King Neptune and his royal family were the centerpiece of the Fish-Man Island Arc, eventually culminating in a devastating realization."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"It turned out that the Mermaid Princess Shirahoshi was the incarnation of Poseidon, one of the Three Ancient Weapons from the Void Century. As Shirahoshi still hasn't come into her powers, however, the Fish-Man Island Arc felt more like a prelude to something far more impressive. And yet, fans enjoyed the delightfully unique undersea world of One Piece . On the other hand, fans didn't quite like the villain Hody Jones, who just seemed like a stronger Arlong."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"With Loguetown being the birthplace of Gol D. Roger, not to mention the first location revealed during the Pirate King's execution in Episode 1, it was only natural that the Straw Hats would make their way there. Luffy is nearly executed by Buggy on the same platform, only for a mysterious bolt of lightning to save him. Not one to count his fortunes, Luffy later engaged with Captain Smoker, whose Smoke-Smoke Fruit was enough to capture the fledgling Rubber Man ."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"However, an unknown man arrived with a gust of wind, the same fan that fans believe was responsible for the lightning. He saved Luffy from Smoker, and the reveal that it was Luffy's father, Monkey D. Dragon, came much later. Zoro's side venture ended with him finding two more swords, whereas Usopp and Sanji had their own battles to deal with, but Dragon's presence is arguably the peak of the Loguetown Arc. Both Dragon and Smoker continued to appear throughout the series, even more so now in the Final Saga."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"During the Punk Hazard Arc, the Straw Hats encounter an island with a unique climate – half the island is filled with incredible heat and lava while the other half is full of freezing snow due to a battle that took place between Admiral Aikanu and Admiral Aokiji. While exploring the island, Monkey D. Luffy, Usopp, Nico Robin, and Roronoa Zoro come across what is eventually revealed to be Kin’emon’s legs."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Finding Kin’emon, and eventually Trafalgar D. Water Law, leads to the eventual alliance between Law and the Straw Hat Pirates. This, in combination with their kidnapping of Caesar Clown, disrupts not only Donquixote Doflamingo’s operations but also that of King of the Beasts Kaido. Thus, the Punk Hazard Arc triggers a series of events that results in the Straw Hats and their allies taking down a Warlord and two Emperors."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Usopp might be the biggest cowerd in the Straw Hats, even when taking Nami and Chopper's timidity into account. But there's no doubt that he was always meant to be part of the crew that would find the One Piece. Nami, Zoro, and Luffy arrive at the titular Syrup Village in the East Blue Saga, where they meet Usopp for the first time. Despite exhibiting his cowardice right off the bat, Usopp impresses Luffy enough to receive an invitation."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,Viewers will love One Piece even more when they understand the cultural layers under the surface of concepts like “nakama” and “gaman”.
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Usopp's backstory also links him to his father Yasopp, a member of Shanks' crew. And now that the Straw Hats are on the same course as the Red Hair Pirates, especially with their recent entry to Elbaph, fans are hoping for a reunion that's been postponed for years. The villainous Kuro isn't really as troublesome as later antagonists, but Usopp's determination to save his beloved Kaya rubs off on the Straw Hats. Most importantly, however, the Syrup Village arc is where they find their first ship: the Going Merry ."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"When Monkey D. Luffy and his crew begin their journey in the East Blue, they quickly realize their ship won't be able to function without one important role: a cook. This ultimately leads them to the Baratie, a floating restaurant that is home to Sanji, Chef Zeff, and several other hot-tempered cooks from the East Blue. Watching Luffy convince Sanji to join the Straw Hats will always be a memorable One Piece moment, eclipsed only by Sanji's heartbreaking farewell to the Baratie."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Although the Baratie Arc is early in One Piece 's narrative, it lays the groundwork for several key relationships — Sanji and Zeff, Zoro and Mihawk , and Nami and Arlong, to name a few — that play a major role in later arcs. This, coupled with the dramatic action that takes place while the Straw Hat Pirates are at the restaurant, easily qualifies the Baratie Arc as one of the best sections of the East Blue Saga. In terms of the overall narrative, however, the Baratie Arc can only go as high as #20 on this list."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Timeskips are utilized in a variety of anime series, but arguably no franchise has handled this concept better than One Piece . The two-year timeskip that follows the death of Portgas D. Ace completely changes the landscape of the series, opening the door for the highly-anticipated reunion of the Straw Hat Pirates in Sabaody Archipelago."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Watching the Straw Hat Pirates make their way back to the last location they were together is almost therapeutic, and it signals that each member of Luffy's crew is ready for the challenges of the New World. Overall, the Return to Sabaody Arc may be brief, but it's one of the most impactful and carefully-handled sections of the entire series. From this point on, the vastly stronger Straw Hats would be spending all of their time in the New World."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Filler arcs rarely share the quality of the canonical storylines, even in One Piece , but there's one spectacular exception. The G-8 Arc has no place in the manga, but it still shows the Straw Hats' persistent growth, even in times of great stress. When the Going Merry falls from Skypiea, it accidentally crashes inside the G-8 Marine base. The ship is immediately impounded, forcing the crew to separate across the base."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"In this astonishingly well-written plot, every single member of the Straw Hats use their own talents to find their way back to each other and the Going Merry. Robin's disguise as a Marine historian is easily one of her most remarkable arcs, whereas Sanji and Luffy find themselves in the Marine kitchens. There is both individual labor and teamwork in the G-8 Arc, and the Straw Hats successfully pull off both. Anti-filler anime fans should really give this one a go."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"The East Blue saga (and therefore the entire One Piece narrative) begins with the short yet exciting Romance Dawn Arc. This arc is simple and much more lighthearted than what comes later in the series, but it also has a thrilling sense of endless possibilities, since Luffy could go absolutely anywhere from here."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"In the Romance Dawn Arc, the Gum-Gum Fruit is introduced , Roronoa Zoro makes his memorable debut, and Luffy motivates a young Koby to pursue his own dreams. Romance Dawn is simple, hence its low rank among the best One Piece arcs, but it still sets the tone for the franchise well. It's a great warmup for what is to come while establishing many series staples, from Luffy's effort to recruit new crew members to Luffy's habit of exploring islands and defeating numerous enemy bosses."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Nami's unexpected sickness prompts the Straw Hats to find a doctor, which takes them to Drum Island. The tyrannical Wapol's regime showcases how the cruelty of rulers cause the suffering of citizens, a microcosm of the bigger problem that is the World Government. Kureha, an accomplished doctor, takes Nami under her care. This is when Chopper comes into the picture as Kureha's medical student, who grudgingly develops a bond with the Straw Hats."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Fire is said to be the greatest threat to the land of Elbaph; however, a friendly bond between Ace and Little Oars Jr. may have proven otherwise."
https://www.cbr.com/best-one-piece-anime-arcs/,"Chopper had always been cautious around strange humans, as they tended to abuse or attack him. And yet, Luffy dismissed Chopper's hesitation and proudly claimed that he would become the Straw Hats' official doctor. The Drum Island Arc demonstrates one of Luffy's most notable traits: his ability to make allies out of nearly anyone. This is the same feature that Dracule Mihawk would later highlight as the reason for Luffy being the most dangerous man in the world."
